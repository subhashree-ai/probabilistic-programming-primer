    "While most of PyMC3's user-facing features are written in pure Python, it leverages Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010) to transparently transcode models to C and compile them to machine code, thereby boosting performance. Theano is a library that allows expressions to be defined using generalized vector data structures called **tensors**, which are tightly integrated with the popular NumPy `ndarray` data structure, and similarly allow for broadcasting and advanced indexing, just as NumPy arrays do. Theano also automatically optimizes the likelihood's computational graph for speed and provides simple GPU integration."

    "* __transparent use of a GPU__ – Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)\n",

This helps it achieve dramatically faster convergence on large problems than traditional sampling methods achieve. \n",
