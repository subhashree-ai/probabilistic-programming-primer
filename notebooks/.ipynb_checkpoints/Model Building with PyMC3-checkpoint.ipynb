Hence, you know a variable is a subclass of `Factor` whenever it has a `logp` method, as we saw in the previous section.\n",

Points in parameter space are represented by dictionaries with parameter names as they keys and the value of the parameters as the values.\n",

This function may employ other random variables in its calculation. \n",
